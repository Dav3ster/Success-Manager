#Success-Manager

## Describtion 

This challenge made me more familiar with using node.js and modules, espeically in how they are interlinked. The Application uses backend JavaScript to generate a team.html file. I also got use to using npm tools such as inquirer to prompt users for information in the terminal. Overall this was a good challenge that showed me how backend can be used to generate frontend products.
